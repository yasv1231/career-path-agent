User Response Sample 1

I am currently a sophomore majoring in Software Engineering. My academic performance is above average. My family comes from a typical working-class background and does not have many resources. I hope to achieve a relatively stable income within three years, ideally earning over RMB 10,000 per month right after graduation. I am interested in technology, but I do not want to work long-term overtime or live in top-tier cities. Shenzhen would be acceptable, but I prefer not to go to Beijing or Shanghai. I would consider pursuing a master’s degree, but I do not want to spend three years studying purely theoretical content. I am worried about not finding a job after graduation or being replaced by AI.

I am a freshman and do not have a clear direction for my future yet. My family’s financial situation is relatively comfortable, so I am not in urgent need of income. I have some interest in starting a business, but I am also afraid of failure. I do not like being overly controlled and I do not fit well in extremely competitive environments. I enjoy working on projects independently, such as building websites or developing automation tools. Money is important to me, but so is personal freedom. I can accept lower income in the short term, but I do not want it to remain low permanently.

I am currently a junior. My family hopes that I will take the civil service exam. Personally, I am not very interested in working within the government system, although I acknowledge that stability is attractive. I am introverted and do not enjoy frequent social interactions. I tend to work carefully, but I am not particularly efficient. My biggest concern is that if I do not choose a stable path and fail, it would be embarrassing. I can accept overtime, but I do not want frequent business travel. Ideally, I would like to stay in Guangzhou in the future.

I graduated one year ago and currently work as a front-end developer in a small company, earning around RMB 7,000 per month. I feel that my growth is slow and my tasks are repetitive. I want to transition into the AI field but do not know where to start. I can accept a decrease in income within the first year if necessary, but I hope to see significant improvement in two or three years. I am open to moving to first-tier cities and can tolerate high-pressure environments. I have no financial burden from my family. My biggest fear is choosing the wrong direction and wasting time.

My biggest fear is choosing the wrong direction and losing three to five years without being able to recover.
